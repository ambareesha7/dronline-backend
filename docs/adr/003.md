# Decide way of handling record autoclose

## Context

MH asked us to implement autoclose of records when:

- every participant provided his/her medical summary
- there's no pending dispatch of triage unit

## Decision

We will use synchronous non-transactional function calls [2019-09-24]

## Reason

We don't want to make autoclose flow transactional as the autoclose should not fail valid medical summary insertion. We also don't want to utilize the EventStore for this, because whole autoclose logic should be a matter of few milliseconds (there's no need for it to be handled in separate process) and events would make tests harder to write.

## Consequences

In rare occasion when something happens to the server between saving medical summary and calling autoclose, record may be not closed properly. The problem can be resolved by either manual closing of record (we have this implemented already) or a worker which will detect when something like this happens (it's hypothetical solution).

## Alternatives

- synchronous transactional function calls
- asynchronous events handling
