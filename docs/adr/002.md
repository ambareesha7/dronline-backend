# Place tests in lib dir instead of test dir

## Context

Having two trees of directories with same structure (one for implementation and one for tests) was inconvenient. Default project structure generated by mix is meant for hex libraries, it is not optimal for big enterprise projects.

## Decision

Approved [past decision]

## Reason

- having implementation and tests in same dir makes code review much easier (alphabetical order of files in MR)
- tests provides additional documentation, easier access to them is better

## Consequences

Most developers know default directory structure better. New team members will have to get used to customized project structure.

## Alternatives

Leave default project structure as is.
