# Use Google Protocol Buffers for data serialization in our API

## Context

It was necessary to decide how our api will be serialized

## Decision

Approved [past decision]

## Reason

- writing protobufs definitions (`.proto` files) makes our API self-documented
- protobufs are faster to encode/decode than json
- less data is sent over the wire
- better support of backward-compatibility
- protobufs check data types

## Consequences

- Developers outside of AppUnite may not be used to work with protobufs
- New team members may need additional training
- Phoenix Channels require some additional work before they can use protobufs

## Alternatives

- JSON API
- GraphQL
